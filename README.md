## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Through the process of making this project I learned and used SASS to write stylesheet.

- I also used JS to toggle class (add/remove) from elements on click events. It is easier to toggle class to change properties instead of writing it through JS. Let JS do its own work.

### Useful resources

- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - This helped me to understand and write down markdown.

- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Contains the installation guide and docs for SASS.
